        {- ^
            An action that runs forever, perpetually listening for
            incoming connections and running the @(Socket -> IO a)@
            function each time a new client opens a connection.

{- ^
    For example, suppose you have a function that reads an HTTP request
    from a socket and then writes an HTTP response back to the socket.

    @handleHttpRequest :: 'Socket' -> IO ()@

    Then you might start a server by running the following in GHCi:

    @Î»> 'serve' 8000 handleHttpRequest@

    And while the server is still running, test it on the command line
    like so:

    > $ curl http://localhost:8000
